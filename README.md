### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am 2nd year Software Development student in University of Stirling. 
I am currently working on Java and web projects. Designing and building PL/SQL systems.
I like to work on real life solutions which could enhance productivity and quality of life.
Through my years as student I have been involved in projects which implemented Java, C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.

In future I'd love to learn more about hardware programming and robotics.
