# üëã Hi, I'm Atanas Chelibashki

I'm a **4th-year Software Development with Cyber Security** student at the **University of Stirling**. I have a passion for building software solutions that tackle **real-world challenges**, enhance **productivity**, and **improve quality of life**. I specialize in **Java-based systems**, **web technologies**, **system administration**, and **DevOps** practices.

## üöÄ What I'm Currently Working On

### MultiAgentExchangeArena
The **MultiAgentExchangeArena** project is a transformation of the existing **ResourceExchangeArena** simulation into a **decentralized energy management system** using modern technologies. This project aims to:
- Develop a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** using the **JADE (Java Agent Development Framework)** to facilitate **time-slot exchanges** for energy usage between household agents in decentralized microgrids.
- Explore two MAS architectures:
  - **Broker-Agent Model**: A central broker coordinates time-slot exchanges.
  - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model**: Agents negotiate directly with each other.
- Integrate **blockchain technology** (Ethereum) for **secure transaction recording**, utilizing **smart contracts** to automate exchange conditions and ensure transparency.

The project focuses on optimizing **energy distribution**, improving **scalability**, and showcasing the benefits of **MAS and blockchain** for decentralized energy management. Performance will be evaluated based on metrics such as **transaction efficiency**, **agent satisfaction**, and **resource usage**.
