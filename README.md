### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am 2nd year Software Development with Cyber Security student in University of Stirling. 
I am currently working on Java and web based projects. Designing and building PL/SQL systems.
I would like to work on real life solutions which could enhance productivity and quality of life.
Through my years as student I have been involved in projects which implemented Java, C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.

I have been involved in several Ethical Hacking courses performing basic network scanning, packet sniffing, and launching exploits towards 
test machines. For the purpose of those courses I have been thought to work with Kali Linux.
During those courses I have gained knwoledge and experience how to set up virtual machines and how to establish virtual networks using VirtualBox.

I am CompTIA Hardware and Networking Fundamentals certified.
I am also Oracle Certified Junior Associate with Java Fundamentals Programming,
and studying towards Java Object Oriented Programming,Database Design and Programming with PL/SQL courses.

In future I'd love to learn more about low level programming and robotics. I am interested in IoT security and how to create 
our personal digital space more secure.

I'll use this profile to upload projects on which I have been working on for my college and university tasks and assessments.
I'll also upload projects on which I work during my spare time.
