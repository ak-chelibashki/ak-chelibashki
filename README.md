### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am 3rd year Software Development with Cyber Security student in University of Stirling. 
I am currently coding Java and web based projects. Designing and building PL/SQL systems.
I would like to work on real life solutions which could enhance productivity and quality of life.

I have been involved in several Ethical Hacking courses performing basic network scanning, packet sniffing, and launching exploits towards 
test machines. For the purpose of those courses I have been using Kali Linux.
I have gained knwoledge and experience how to set up virtual machines and how to establish virtual networks using VirtualBox.

In future I'd love to learn more about low level programming and robotics. 
I am interested in IoT security and how to create our personal digital space more secure.

I'll use this profile to upload projects on which I work during my spare time.
