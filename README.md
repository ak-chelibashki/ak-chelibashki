Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Atanas Chelibashki, a 4th-year Software Development with Cyber Security student at the University of Stirling. I specialize in building Java-based systems, working with web technologies, and handling DevOps processes to streamline software deployment. My recent experiences have deepened my skills in system administration, CI/CD automation, and integrating microservices, while also working closely with customers to refine requirements and conduct user testing.

ðŸš€ Latest Projects
MultiAgentExchangeArena
I'm currently working on the MultiAgentExchangeArena project, which transforms the existing ResourceExchangeArena simulation into a decentralized energy management system. The project employs the JADE (Java Agent Development Framework) to create a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for facilitating time-slot exchanges between household agents. The system explores two architectural approaches:

Broker-Agent Model: A central broker coordinates time-slot exchanges.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model: Agents negotiate directly with each other.

To ensure security and transparency, blockchain technology will be integrated using the Ethereum network. The system would leverage smart contracts to automate the enforcement of exchange conditions, providing a tamper-proof record of transactions. The project aims to optimize energy distribution, improve scalability, and showcase the benefits of using MAS and blockchain for decentralized energy management.
